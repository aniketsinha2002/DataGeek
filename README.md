# Project Information

This repository contains the code for an educational website. The website makes it easier for aspiring data scientists and learners to get a simple roadmap to becoming well versed with the subject and field. The website contains information about data science, provides links resources such as online courses through which you can enhance your skills.

This webpage is still under construction. I'm making this project open source so that if any one wants to contribute to this project, to make it easier for their fellow learners to grasp the concepts of data science, then genuinly you are welcome here :)

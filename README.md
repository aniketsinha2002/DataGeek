# Project Information

The source code for the educational website Data Science is available in this repository. This website was developed for aspiring students who are interested in data science and it gives you access to resources, including courses, that can help you develop your abilities. To direct users to the desired area of the website, the website is made up of a number of different sections, including home, about, courses, FAQ, and contact. Students can sign up and begin their career as a data scientist.

This webpage is still under construction. I'm making this project open source so that if any one wants to contribute to this project, to make it easier for their fellow learners to grasp the concepts of data science, then genuinly you are welcome here :)
